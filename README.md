### Project Domain:
An android app made on Flutter, Backend made on Django and GraphQL, Portals made on HTML, CSS, Javascript 


### Abstract:
#### 1.Health- Our app uses an AI Tensorflow model as a personal trainer of the user to guide the user about the correct exercise poses while he is doing exercises just by turning on his camera in the absence of any actual physical trainer. We have also provided a period tracker in our app for female users.
#### 2. Emergency services- Our app has an emergency health prompt feature for the user which he can use in case of any health emergency and the trainers will be available to answer any kind of queries or prescriptions.

### Introduction:
During the lockdown, most of us became unhealthy by sitting in front of screens for long hours so we thought of building something which could help in improving the health of users while they exercise just being at their homes with their camera on. We are going to build an app that will use an AI model (Tensorflow model) to determine if a user is doing a specified exercise correctly based on their body alignment. The app will have a dedicated server for trainers who will be available in case any user prompts for emergency help when not feeling fit about his body or has any queries. The app will also have additional features like a period tracker for women users along with daily fitness analysis based on the daily workout routine of the user.
